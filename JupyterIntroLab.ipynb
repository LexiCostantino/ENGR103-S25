    "\n",
    "Jupyter (the program by which you're reading this) supports 2 types of cells: _Markdown_ and _code_. You can choose the type of cell that you would like to create by using the following dropdown menu:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smithrockmaker/PH211/master/images/cellType.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell was created using Markdown. The code cells use the Python coding language to perform some type of computation. What you do in one type of cell does not impact what you do in the other type of cell---they are seperate in that they don't \"talk\" to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is used for _communicating to other humans using/reading your document_. Python is used for _coding_.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start a notebook the markdown cells are usually 'rendered' meaning they have been processed to yield the intended output. This is similar to the html code that is behind a webpage. Note that you did not have to run this Markdown code before seeing the intended output. \n",
    "\n",
    "1: To access the markdown syntax that produces the desired output you can double click on this cell. When you do so you should see things change inside this particular unit of the notebook. This unit is called a cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "2: When you want to see the rendered version of the cell 'shift+enter/return' will render the active cell (the one with the blue bar next to it on the left). Try these two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can edit the text and other markdown syntax much like you do in a standard word processing program. You will find that you can **NOT** edit the text or syntax when the cell is rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3: To create a new cell use the '+' at the top of your notebook window. \n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/LexiCostantino/ENGR103-S24/blob/main/images/IntroLab1.jpg?raw=true\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new cell after the currently active cell. When you do so the new cell will, by default, expect that it is a code cell. This is indicated by the small brackets to the left of the cell.  \n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smithrockmaker/PH211/master/images/codeCell.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "To let the notebook know that you want it to be a markdown cell select 'markdown' from the dropdown menu just below the notebook title.  \n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smithrockmaker/PH211/master/images/cellType.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that the small brackets have disappeared.  \n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smithrockmaker/PH211/master/images/markdownCell.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Images need to be linked in order to appear in the document. In standard practice, you may choose to keep these files stored in the same folder as your other LaTex/Jupyter documents---this is easiest to manage locally. When I choose to share my files with you all, however, I would rather not have you all download the .tex/.ipynb files *and* a folder full of images. Therefore, I have chosen to upload my images to Github or source them elsewhere on the public web. "

My recommendation is to go to the Jupyterlab 'File' menu and open a new notebook. The new notebook will show up in a separate tab in the Jupyterlab window. Again, in the 'File' menu, use 'Save Notebook As' to save this new notebook with a useful name. Now you will have both this set of instructions and your personal lab notebook open at the same time. "

It is extremely useful for use when typing up documents that have any sort of math in them. It is also useful when typing documents with lots of sources---it makes citing sources very easy!
